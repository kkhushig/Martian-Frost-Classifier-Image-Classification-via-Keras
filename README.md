# Martian Frost Classifier - Image Classification via Keras
This project aims to develop a sentiment analysis classifier using deep learning techniques, specifically focusing on the analysis of positive and negative reviews. The classifier utilizes various architectures, including Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to accurately predict sentiment from textual data.

By employing Keras and Python, this project demonstrates the application of advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques in text classification, paving the way for further exploration in sentiment analysis and related fields. 

## Introduction

Sentiment analysis is a vital area in the field of NLP that involves determining the emotional tone behind a series of words. This project focuses on classifying sentiments from text reviews into positive or negative categories. The data is sourced from two folders containing positive and negative reviews, allowing for a binary classification setup. This repository contains detailed steps taken during the data processing, model training, and evaluation phases.
